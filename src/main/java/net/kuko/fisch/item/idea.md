The menu looks like a retro black and green command line, except with 4 buttons.

The first button has the text "Give Hacker Helmet." When you click the button, you get an item called the Hacker Helmet. It is worn on the head slot. The Hacker Helmet is a green-black helmet in the style of a netherite helmet with a green translucent visor. It applies a green hue on your vision and if you sneak while wearing the helmet, any mobs in a 5 by 5 radius of the player get slowness 255, sets the hp of the mobs to 0, and then knocks them back. It has 5 million armor points.


The second button has the text "Give Pocket Terminal." When you click the button, you get an item called the Pocket Terminal. The Pocket Terminal looks like a CRT tv with a black screen and green text. When you right click with the Pocket Terminal in your main hand, you open a menu where you can select items to give to yourself, like the pig spawn egg, netherite tools and armor, tnt, flint and steel, fireworks, elytra, and creeper spawn egg. If you right click with this item in your offhand, it teleports you to your respawn point.

The third button has the text "Make me invincible." This will set the player's max health to 50, give the player resistance 255, absorption 255, health boost 255, and health regeneration 255.

The fourth button has the text "Give Burger." This gives the player 64 cheeseburgers, 64 plain burgers, and 64 bacon cheeseburgers. Right clicking a mob with any of the three burgers instantly kills them.
